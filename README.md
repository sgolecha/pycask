# PyCask

A Python implementation of the Bitcask key-value store, inspired by the original Bitcask paper from Basho.

## Overview

PyCask is a log-structured hash table for fast key-value storage. This implementation provides:

- **Fast writes**: All writes are sequential appends to log files
- **Fast reads**: In-memory hash table (keydir) for O(1) key lookups

## Features

- âœ… Put and Get operations
- âœ… In-memory key directory for fast lookups
- âœ… Multi-file data storage with automatic rotation
- âœ… CRC32 checksums for data integrity
- ðŸš§ Compaction (planned)
- ðŸš§ Delete operations (planned)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sgolecha/pycask.git
cd pycask
pip install -e .
```

## Architecture

The implementation consists of several key components:

- **KVStore**: Main interface for put/get operations  (TODO)
- **KVWriter**: Handles writing entries to data files (DONE)
- **KVReader**: Handles reading entries from multiple data files (DONE)
- **KVEntry**: Data structure representing key-value records (DONE)
- **KVLocation**: Tracks where entries are stored on disk (DONE)

## Data Format

Each record in the data files contains:
```
[CRC32][Timestamp][KeySize][ValueSize][Key][Value]
```

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```
